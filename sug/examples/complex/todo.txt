BUGS:

  * iframe offset is getting mixed for the draggable components.
  * 'auto' style for left/right needs to compute for some resize/move operations


STRUCTURE:

  * Combine the different css parsing functionality into one 'tokenizer', it should have the source (:inline :computed :sheet) as well.
  * Convertion tool for css measures, this might need to do some tricks to work accurately (changing css, recording the results, then changinging back)
  * Style widgets should use a more composable data format to figure themselves out
  * Collapsable tree component, will be used for outliner and file browser.  Should have general logic for 'folders' and moving nodes around the tree.

NEW FEATURES
  * App will now target the desktop, which gives it the ability to browser files and have a 'project' interconnect
  * Color highlights for styles to show their source (inline/sheets/computed)
  * History/undo/redo via om/clj
  * Color swatches / color dropper tool
  * Multiple documents open at one time


REIMPLEMENT:
  * Ruler guides / snapping
  * Re-arrange outliner nodes


SALVAGE:
  * Color picker widget
  * File browser backend
  * WYSIWYG mode
  * CSS compiling?


SUG OPTIMIZATION
  The pub/sub heirarchy is suspicious as a bottleneck (deep heirarchies have large amounts of event chans)
  * global event chan map, when a handler is defined ensure a key/chan exists in the map and register the handler
  * sparse heirarchy for bubbling - the heirarchy is implicit with the path+key, when an event is fired it checks the
    map for each possible ancestor (which would have registered a chan if it handles that event)
